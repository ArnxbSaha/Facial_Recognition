# Facial_Recognition

An attempt at a streamlined and quick approach to achieve decent results at facial recognition from a unclean and unoptimized dataset of celebrity faces and labels.
This was for the kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/purdue-face-recognition-challenge-2023/overview), lined up with an academic assignment for Purdue ECE:50024-Machine Learning. Datasets used for training can be found within the kaggle website itself, with my jupyter notebook and result labels attached within the repository.
