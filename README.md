# Facial_Recognition

An attempt at a streamlined and quick approach to achieve decent results at facial recognition from a unclean and unoptimized dataset of celebrity faces and labels.

This was for the kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/purdue-face-recognition-challenge-2023/overview), lined up with an academic assignment for Purdue ECE:50024-Machine Learning. Datasets used for training can be found within the kaggle website itself, with my python code and result labels attached within the repository. 

With the aim of my approach being quick to setup and process, with a decent level of accuracy without performing much pre-processing on the training images, the module of face_recognition in python was made use of.
